# Synthetic Bank Statement Generator

This project generates **synthetic bank statements** that mimic real-world Chase bank statements, enabling innovation in financial data processing while preserving the privacy of account holders. By combining Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data generation, and HTML templating, the project produces realistic PDF statements for use in **learning, development, and testing** in controlled environments.

**Important**: The synthetic data generated by this project is strictly for **learning and development purposes** and must not be used for any other purposes, including fraudulent activities or real-world financial applications.

## Why Synthetic Bank Statements?
- **Privacy Protection**: Enables developers to work with realistic financial data without exposing sensitive information.
- **Innovation**: Supports the development of financial tools, machine learning models, and data processing pipelines.
- **Realism**: Produces Chase-specific bank statements with authentic layouts, transaction patterns, and branding.

## Project Objectives

This project addresses three key challenges in generating high-quality synthetic bank statements:

1. **Generating Realistic and Diverse Data**  
   Large Language Models (Mistral via Ollama) and Faker generate realistic transaction descriptions (e.g., "Grocery Store Purchase," "Utility Bill Payment") and diverse synthetic data (e.g., account holder names, addresses, account numbers). This ensures concise, contextually appropriate, and varied datasets that mimic real-world Chase bank statement patterns.

2. **Formatting for Realism**  
   Synthetic statements are rendered in HTML using Jinja2 templates and converted to PDFs with wkhtmltopdf, closely replicating the layout, fonts, and structure of Chase bank statements. Embedded logos and precise formatting ensure compatibility with real-world applications.

3. **Ensuring Template Adaptability**  
   The pipeline aims to support flexible and scalable synthetic statement generation, enabling easy adaptation and expansion to other formats (e.g. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, etc.)

## Current Pipeline

The synthetic bank statement generation process follows these steps:

1. **Data and Template Extraction**  
   - **Tool**: HTML templates created with assistance from LLMs (Grok and ChatGPT).  
   - **Process**: A Chase-specific HTML template (e.g. `chase_final.html`) defines the statement’s structure, with placeholders for mutable fields (e.g., account holder, transactions) and immutable fields (e.g., bank name, headers). The template is analyzed to identify fields using regex and LLMs.  
   - **Challenges**: Ensuring accurate placeholder detection and maintaining consistency with Chase’s branding.

2. **Synthetic Data Generation**  
   - **Tools**: Mistral (via Ollama) for transaction descriptions, Faker for synthetic data.  
   - **Process**: Generate realistic data for account holders, account numbers, addresses, and transactions. LLMs create transaction descriptions and categories (e.g., "Salary Deposit," "Utility Payment"), while Faker populates other fields. Data is stored in a pandas DataFrame for processing.  
   - **Challenges**: Balancing diversity and realism in transaction descriptions while adhering to length constraints.

3. **Output Formatting**  
   - **Tools**: Jinja2 for HTML rendering, wkhtmltopdf for PDF generation.  
   - **Process**: Populate the HTML template with synthetic data, embed the Chase logo as a base64-encoded image, and convert the rendered HTML to a PDF that mimics a Chase bank statement.  
   - **Challenges**: Matching fonts, alignments, and visual elements of real statements; ensuring wkhtmltopdf compatibility across systems.

## Requirements and Dependencies
See [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/ch4444rlie/SynthDat/blob/master/pyproject.toml) for a full list of dependencies. Key requirements include:
- Python 3.13+
- Libraries: `faker`, `pandas`, `ollama`, `jinja2`, `pdfkit`, `pydantic`
- External Tool: `wkhtmltopdf` (required for PDF generation, see [installation instructions](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html))
- Optional: Access to an LLM (Mistral via Ollama) for transaction descriptions

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Install Python 3.13+.
- Install wkhtmltopdf and ensure it’s accessible in your system PATH (default path in code: `C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin\wkhtmltopdf.exe`).
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Place the logo in the `sample_logos/` directory.
- Place the HTML template in the `templates/` directory.

### Running the Project
To run the synthetic bank statement generator yourself, locate the Jupyter Notebook `final_chase_generator.ipynb` in the repository. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the cells and generate synthetic statements. Ensure all prerequisites are met before running.
